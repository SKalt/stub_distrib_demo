# Using this demo
To test out how to distribute python packages including type hinting stub files, create a virtual environment (unless you like to live dangerously) and run `pip install -r requirements.txt; sh ./test.sh`.

# Contributing
If the way to distribute stubs changes or the `mypy` or `pyre-check` APIs change, please submit a PR updating the tests! Similarly, if you'd like to include another type checker or make the demo more readable, feel free to submit your changes.
